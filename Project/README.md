The project titled "Brain Tumor Classification using Deep Learning" has been completed during the course. In this project, different deep learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), UNet and Transfer Learning have been applied to a public dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/denizkavi1/brain-tumor) to classify three types of brain tumors.

Riyad Bin Rafiq, Arefa Patwary and Shoham Weiss equally contributed to the project.
