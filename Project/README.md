The project titled "Brain Tumor Classification using Deep Learning" has been completed during the course. In this project, different deep learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Autoencoder, Transfer Learning have been applied on a public [dataset] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/denizkavi1/brain-tumor) to classify three types of brain tumor.

Riyad Bin Rafiq, Arefa Patwary and Shoham Weiss equally contributed to the project.
